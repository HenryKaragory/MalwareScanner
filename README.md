# MalwareScanner
System 2 Class Project

### Members
A simple malware scanner by Henry Karagory, Jacob Grove, and Ian Yang.

### Overview
The program is able to find malware processes by name or by a given regular expression and it gives the user the ability to kill the process. 
The regular expression will be given through the prompts or through command line arguments. 
The name of any processes that have been killed can be saved into the config file to make it easier to discover the process in the future.

### Description
The program utilizes four main files in order to get information, look for processes, and kill processes:

#### get_options.c
Includes functions that store the information about what the user wants to look for, and has different functions depending on the search method.

#### malware_finder.c
The main function that goes through each step of the program. Determines the search method and calls all the other processes.

#### mware_sys_call.c
Makes the system call to kill the processes.

#### utility.c
Includes a loop that iterates through each process that matches the given regular expression and finds out what the user wants to do with the process.

### Operating Instructions
Download the zip file. Go into the MalwareScanner folder. Compile the program using the Makefile.
Run malware_finder and give command line arguments if desired.
Additional information about running the program or the demonstration, and adding to the configuration file can be found in sections 3 and 4 of the user manual.
